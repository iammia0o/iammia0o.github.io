abstract = {Gastric interoception, the perception of gastric sensations, influences both emotions and intuition. Despite its potential for novel interaction design, gut sensing for influencing gastric interoception remains underexplored. In this work we present two initial investigations toward GutIO, gut interfaces that can sense abdominal sounds associated with gut feelings and manipulate gastric interoception through haptic feedback. We collected 12 hours of abdominal sounds from six participants watching emotion-inducing movies to identify abdominal sound characteristics corresponding to gut-feelings. Using these, we created four abdominal-sound-driven haptic feedback patterns and studied their effects on perceived gastric sensations, emotions, and intuition with 12 participants. Results showed that our haptic feedback is perceived as more realistic, and strongly influences perceptions of gastric activities. This work demonstrates the potential of detecting gut feelings through abdominal sounds and influencing gastric interoception, opening new possibilities for interaction design.},

    abstract = "Emotion-Cause analysis has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. However, most existing datasets are limited in size and number of emotion categories. They often focus on extracting parts of the document that contain the emotion cause and fail to provide more abstractive, generalizable root cause. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of emotion causes, derived from 9.8 million cleaned tweets over 15 years. We describe our curation process, which includes a comprehensive pipeline for data gathering, cleaning, labeling, and validation, ensuring the dataset{'}s reliability and richness. We extract emotion labels and provide abstractive summarization of the events causing emotions. The final dataset comprises over 700,000 tweets with corresponding emotion-cause pairs spanning 48 emotion classes, validated by human evaluators. The novelty of our dataset stems from its broad spectrum of emotion classes and the abstractive emotion cause that facilitates the development of an emotion-cause knowledge graph for nuanced reasoning. Our dataset will enable the design of emotion-aware systems that account for the diverse emotional responses of different people for the same event.",
