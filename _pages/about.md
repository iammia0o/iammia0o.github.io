<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a PhD candidate at [Augmented Human Lab](https://ahlab.org), [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) under the supervision of [Prof. Suranga Nanayakkara](https://suranga.info). I am broadly interested in the human mind, emotion, and artificial intelligence. My research focuses on designing technologies that expand people's affective capacity to enhance their emotional resilience and well-being. Before joining NUS, I spent 4 years at [Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology](https://unist.ac.kr) in South Korea studying Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences, and 2 years in Vietnam working as a Research Engineer at [Trusting Social](https://trustingsocial.com).
