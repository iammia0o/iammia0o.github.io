Storytelling has been a fundamental tool for sharing knowledge and fostering connections throughout human history. Across cultures, it has served as a means to pass down wisdom, traditions, and values from one generation to the next. Storytelling strengthens family bonds by creating shared memories and deepening understanding among family members.

However, modern life presents challenges to this age-old practice. Many families are geographically dispersed, making regular face-to-face interactions rare. Additionally, not everyone feels confident in their storytelling abilities, which can lead to fewer meaningful exchanges and a sense of disconnection among family members.

In this project, we investigate the effect of storytelling using an AI-assisted storytelling application on intergenerational bonding, elderly's loneliness and confidence.
