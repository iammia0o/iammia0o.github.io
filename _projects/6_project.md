Do emotions create detectable changes in abdominal sounds? Can we use abdominal sounds to in turn influence emotions and gut feelings?

In this project, we explored the potential of abdomial sounds for sensing emotions and inducing gut feelings through 2 studies. In the first study, we induced emotions and gut feelings in users and trained a machine learning model to see if they can pick up the changes create by emotions in abdomial sounds. In the second study, we used abdominal sounds found in clusters in study 1 and created haptic patterns to influence people's gastric interoception. We found that abdominal sound is a potential new modality for both sensing emotions and influencing gastric interoception. This work set the groundwork for future work to further explore gut-based interaction.
