Are words just a tool to describe your inner states, or are they essential to shape our very perception of this world?

You guessed it correctly! Language shapes our perception, crystalizing abstractive concepts and draw similarities from categories that are so different. Without a label, a butterfly in the stomach, a fluttering heartbeat, and an electrifying feeling would be all so different. But with a label, we can call these feelings toward our partner “love”.  Impairing access to the semantic meanings of emotion words have been shown to impair the perceptions of emotional faces. In another words, emotion words constitute our emotional experience. 

In this project, we explore the use of language, more specifically, granular emotional words, to improve emotion regulation ability. We hypothesize that providing granular emotion word at right place and right time can help individuals crystalize new emotional concepts and in turn improve their emotion regulation ability.
